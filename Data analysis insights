Project Description:

In this data analysis project, I executed a thorough analysis of COVID-19 data using Python within Jupyter Notebook. Employing Pandas and NumPy, I conducted data cleaning, filling in missing values with SimpleImputer, and explored trends through insightful visualizations with Matplotlib. The project involved a meticulous cleaning process to handle missing values, ensuring the integrity of the dataset. Through Pandas and NumPy, I efficiently manipulated the data, paving the way for meaningful insights. Visualizations created with Matplotlib provided a clear representation of trends, offering valuable perspectives on the progression of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries. Additionally, the calculated metrics, including Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Recovery Rate, and Active Cases Percentage, added depth to the analysis. The identification of top affected countries/regions based on the highest percentage of active cases further enriched the project's findings. Through a systematic and insightful analysis, this project contributes to a better understanding of the global COVID-19 landscape.
